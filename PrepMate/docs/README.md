# Development process

In this project, the software development approach Agile is used. By applying the Scrum framework we can easily keep track of the progress of each individual developer and the team as a whole. Weekly scrum meetings will ensure that each member is up-to-date and involved in the planning process. We collectively reflect on our app development, potential obstacles or issues and areas of improvement. By confirming all developers are on the same page, we can keep working towards our goal with any misunderstandings and take the key points from our reflection into account.

The table below contains a schedule with the role of Scrum Master and Secretary for each week.
