# Week 2.2 meeting

Note: this meeting was not yet conducted using the scrum framework, which started in week 2.3

**Notetaker:** Yasmina

### To Do:

- Ask TA for feedback on Project Plan
- Look through project plan individually, and then discuss anything that might need to be changed or added
- convert requirements to user stories
- Implement (other) feedback points from TA

### Feedback from TA on Project Plan:

- add a small introduction
- use more specific titles
- restructure ‘purpose of application’, first state the problem then the solution.
- example ethical implication: data storage from users
- links to comparable software (or footnote)
- comparison to existing software: explicitly state what will be different/better (if that is the case, and if we have time)
- include non-functional requirements (for example code libraries) -> (amended, not necessary after all)
- code libraries: use hyperlinks
- if we use authentication: write it as a could have
- write requirements into user stories
- rewrite GUI requirement: a bit vague. Focus on functionality
- merge request: only with new feature (instead of for 'large' changes)

### Done:

- Implemented feedback
- Finished and handed in Project Plan
