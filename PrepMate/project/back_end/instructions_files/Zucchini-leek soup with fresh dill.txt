Preheat the oven to 200 degrees and prepare the stock.
Press the garlic or chop finely. Cut the zucchini into cubes and the leek into rings. Coarsely chop the dill.
Heat 1/4 tbsp olive oil per person in a soup pot with a lid over medium heat. Add the garlic, leek and zucchini and fry for 6 – 8 minutes. Add the stock to the stockpot, reduce the heat and let the soup simmer, covered, for 5 – 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
In the meantime, cut half the sandwich into cubes and the other half into 1 cm thick slices. Divide the slices over a baking tray lined with baking paper and spread with half of the green pesto. Drizzle with some olive oil if desired and bake in the oven for 8 – 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil per person in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the Sicilian spice mix and fry the bread pieces until brown for 6 – 7 minutes. Add extra olive oil if necessary if the croutons are sticking. Season with salt and pepper.
Season the soup well with salt and pepper. Puree the soup with a hand blender until it is smooth. Add more stock or water if you find the soup too thick. Then stir the remaining pesto into the soup.
Divide the soup among bowls or deep plates and garnish with the sour cream, croutons and dill. If desired, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil to taste. Serve with the pesto bruschettas.
