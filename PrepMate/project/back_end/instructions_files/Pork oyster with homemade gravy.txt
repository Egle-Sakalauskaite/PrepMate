Remove the pork oyster from the refrigerator.
Preheat the oven to 160 degrees.
Prepare the broth.
Bring plenty of water to the boil in a pan with a lid.
Chop the shallot and press or finely chop the garlic. Peel the potatoes or wash them thoroughly and cut into large pieces. Cut the carrot into 2 cm cubes.
Cook the carrot, covered, in the pan with a lid for 20 minutes. After 5 minutes, add the potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Make sure the carrot and potatoes are well covered with water. Drain as soon as both are done, but reserve a little of the cooking liquid and let it steam without the lid.
Heat 1 tbsp butter per person in a frying pan over medium heat and fry the shallot and garlic for 3 – 4 minutes.
Rub the pork oyster with salt and pepper.
Remove half the shallot and garlic from the frying pan and set aside.
Add the pork oyster to the frying pan and fry for 3 – 4 minutes until brown on all sides. Then remove the pork oyster from the pan, place in an oven dish and bake in the oven for 6 - 8 minutes. Then remove from the oven and cut into slices.
Increase the heat of the frying pan to high and deglaze the remaining shallot and garlic with the stock and 1 tsp black balsamic vinegar per person. Season the gravy with 1/2 tsp mustard per person and pepper. Let it reduce by half for 4 – 6 minutes. Just before serving, add 1 tbsp cold butter per person. Stir well with a whisk.
Bring plenty of water to the boil in a saucepan for the snow peas and cook the snow peas for 4 – 6 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold water.
Add the remaining shallot and garlic to the pan with carrot and potatoes. Mash into a fine puree with a potato masher. If necessary, add a little cooking liquid to make it smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Divide the carrot puree among the plates and place the pork oyster next to it. Spoon the snow peas on top and serve with the meat gravy.
