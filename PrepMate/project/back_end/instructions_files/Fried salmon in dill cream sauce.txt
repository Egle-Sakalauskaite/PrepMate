Bring plenty of water to the boil in a pan with a lid for the potatoes.
Wash the potatoes thoroughly and cut into large pieces.
Boil the potatoes, covered, for 12 - 15 minutes. Drain, reserve some of the cooking liquid and keep warm, covered.
In the meantime, press the garlic or chop finely. Remove the stems from the green beans and cut in half. Cut the carrot into thin half slices.
Heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil per person in a wok or frying pan with a lid over medium heat. Fry half the garlic for 1 minute. Add the green beans and carrot and stir-fry for 2 - 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add 3 tbsp water per person and cook, covered, for a further 8 - 10 minutes, or until the green beans and carrot are tender.
In the meantime, finely chop the dill.
Pat the salmon fillet dry with kitchen paper and rub with salt and pepper.
Heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil per person in a frying pan over medium heat and fry the salmon fillet on the skin for 3 - 5 minutes. Reduce the heat and fry the salmon for another 1 â€“ 2 minutes on the other side. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the pan and let rest under aluminum foil.
Roughly mash the potatoes with a potato masher and add some cooking liquid and 1 tsp mustard per person to make it smooth. Season the puree with salt and pepper.
In the same pan with the vegetables, heat 1/2 tbsp butter per person and fry the remaining garlic with the flour for 1 minute. Deglaze the pan with the cooking cream and 50 ml of water per person. Crumble 1/4 stock cube per person above the pan and add the dill. Cook for another 3 minutes.
Divide the potatoes, vegetables and salmon among the plates. Serve a little dill cream sauce over the salmon and the remaining sauce in a bowl next to it.
