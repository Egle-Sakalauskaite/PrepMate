Bring plenty of water to the boil in a pan for the pasta. Crumble 1/4 stock cube per person above the pan with water.
Cook the penne for 9 - 11 minutes. Drain, but reserve a little of the cooking liquid and let it steam out.
Press the garlic or chop finely. Strip the leaves from the thyme and oregano and finely chop the oregano leaves.
Heat 1/2 tbsp olive oil per person in a frying pan over medium heat. Stir-fry the vegetable mix together with the garlic and fresh herbs for 3 - 5 minutes.
In the meantime, coarsely chop the almonds.
Add the cooking cream, soft goat cheese, honey, white wine vinegar and mustard to the pan with vegetables. Mix everything well and add some cooking water from the pasta to the sauce if necessary.
Heat the sauce for another 2 - 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
Add the pasta to the skillet and mix well.
Divide the pasta among deep plates. Garnish with the grated goat cheese and almond pieces.
