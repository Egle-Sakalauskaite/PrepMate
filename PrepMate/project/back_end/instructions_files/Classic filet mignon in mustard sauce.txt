Preheat the oven to 210 degrees.
Remove the filet mignon from the refrigerator to let it come to room temperature.
Press the garlic or chop finely. Wash the potatoes and cut into wedges.
Mix the potatoes in a bowl with the garlic and 1/2 tbsp olive oil per person . Season with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes on a baking tray lined with baking paper and bake in the oven for 25 - 35 minutes. Turn halfway through.
Finely chop the curly parsley. Chop the onion very finely.
Separate the leaves from the little gem, but leave them whole. Halve the red cherry tomatoes.
In a salad bowl, mix the extra virgin olive oil, white wine vinegar, onion and 1/2 tbsp mustard per person into a dressing. Season with salt and pepper. Mix the little ginger leaves and red cherry tomatoes with the dressing.
Pat the filet mignon dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
Heat the butter with the remaining olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat (do this about 10 minutes before the potatoes are done). When the butter starts to turn light brown, place the meat in the pan and fry the filet mignon for 1 - 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and let rest under aluminum foil for at least 3 minutes.
Add per person: 25 ml water and 1/4 tbsp mustard to the pan with shortening, mix into a gravy and season with salt and pepper. Cook until desired thickness.
Mix the curly parsley with the potatoes and divide among the plates.
Cut the filet mignon into slices and place next to the potatoes. Pour the mustard sauce over the meat. Serve with the salad and mayonnaise.
