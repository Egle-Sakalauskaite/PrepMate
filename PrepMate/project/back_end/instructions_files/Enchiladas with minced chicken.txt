Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Drain the corn. Finely chop the red onion.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Fry the onion and half of the corn for 1 - 2 minutes. Add the minced chicken and 1/2 bag of Mexican herbs per person and fry for 2 - 3 minutes. Add the passata and fry for another 2 - 4 minutes.
Top the carrot tortillas with the minced meat-passata mixture. Fold the tortillas and place them side by side in an oven dish. Sprinkle the cheddar over the tortillas and bake in the oven for 5 - 10 minutes.
In the meantime, cut the tomato into cubes.
In a salad bowl, prepare a vinaigrette for each person: 1 tsp white balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper.
Just before serving, mix with the tomato, mixed lettuce and remaining corn.
Serve the enchiladas with the salad and sour cream.
