Remove the leaves from the radish and cut the radish into thin slices. Cut the cucumber into thin sticks of about 4 cm long and 1/2 cm thick.
Mix a dressing per person in a bowl: 1 1/2 tbsp white balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp sugar and a pinch of salt. Mix in the cucumber and radish. Set aside and stir regularly.
Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and peel and cut the flesh into cubes. Cut the spring onion into very fine rings.
In a second bowl, mix the extra virgin olive oil with per person: 1 tsp soy sauce, 1/4 tbsp white balsamic vinegar and 1/2 tsp sugar. Add the spring onion and stir well. Set aside.
Fill a large frying pan with cold water. Place a rice sheet completely in the water and soak for 5 - 10 seconds. Remove the rice sheet from the water and place on a plate. Using a teaspoon, divide some of the cucumber and radish, avocado, spring onion, salmon and soy beans over the rice sheet. Fold the top of the rice sheet inwards over the filling. Fold the sides inward. Then roll up the spring roll tightly.
Repeat the soaking, filling and rolling process for the other rice sheets, until there are 4 spring rolls per person. Divide the filled spring rolls among the plates. Drizzle with the sriracha mayo (note: spicy! Use to taste) and serve.
