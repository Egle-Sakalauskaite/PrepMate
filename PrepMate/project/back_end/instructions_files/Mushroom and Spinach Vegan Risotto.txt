Finely chop the onion. Press the garlic or chop finely. Slice the mushrooms. Chop the spinach.
In a large pan, saut√© onion and garlic in olive oil until softened. Add mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture. Stir in rice and cook for 1-2 minutes. Pour in the white wine and allow it to be absorbed by the rice.
Begin adding the warm vegetable broth a ladle at a time, stirring frequently. Allow each ladle to be absorbed before adding the next. Continue this process until the rice is creamy and cooked to al dente.
Stir in nutritional yeast, fresh spinach, salt, and pepper.
