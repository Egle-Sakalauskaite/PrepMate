Press the garlic or chop finely. Chop the onion. Remove the seeds from the red pepper (note: spicy! Use to taste) and cut into thin strips. Peel the ginger and grate finely. Squeeze the lime into a bowl for the marinade and set aside. Cut the turkey fillet into equal pieces of approximately 3 cm.
Add half the ginger, red pepper and garlic and per person: 3 tbsp soy sauce and 1/2 tbsp honey to the bowl with lime juice. Stir into a marinade. Mix the turkey with the marinade so that it is completely covered.
In the meantime, remove the stems from the green beans and cut into 3 equal pieces.
Heat 1/2 tbsp sunflower oil per person in a wok or frying pan with a lid over medium heat. Add the onion, the remaining ginger, red pepper, garlic and the wok paste. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the coconut milk and per person: 50 ml water and 1/4 stock cube. Stir well and add the green beans. Bring to the boil and simmer, covered, for 15 - 18 minutes.
In the meantime, bring plenty of water to the boil in a pan with a lid for the rice.
Cook the rice, covered, for 12 - 15 minutes. Then drain and let it steam without the lid.
Thread the marinated turkey onto the skewers.
Heat 1/2 tbsp sunflower oil per person in a frying pan or grill pan. Cook the turkey satay for 4 - 5 minutes per side, or until done. If necessary, add the remaining marinade to the pan at the end and fry for 1 minute with the turkey satay. Please note: this can burn quickly. If necessary, lower the heat a little and immediately cover the pan with water after baking.
Divide the rice and braised beans among the plates. Place the marinated turkey satay on top of the rice.
