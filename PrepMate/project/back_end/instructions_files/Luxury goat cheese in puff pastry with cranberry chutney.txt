Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Wash the potatoes and cut into wedges. Press the garlic or chop finely. Strip the leaves from the rosemary and chop finely. Coarsely chop the walnuts.
Mix the potato wedges, garlic, rosemary and 1/2 tbsp olive oil per person in a bowl. Heat a frying pan with a lid and fry the potato wedges, covered, for 25 - 30 minutes over medium heat. After 15 minutes, remove the lid from the pan. Stir regularly. Season with salt and pepper.
Cut half a roll of puff pastry per person in half.
Place 1 piece of puff pastry per person on a baking tray lined with baking paper and top with the cranberry chutney, 1 goat cheese slice per person and the walnuts. Season with salt and pepper. Wet the edges of the puff pastry and place the other piece of puff pastry on top. Place a small bowl of about 12 - 14 cm upside down on the filled puff pastry and cut along the edge so that you are left with 1 round pie. Press the edges with a fork and brush the patties with milk (see Tip). Make a small slit in the center and bake in the oven for 18 - 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.
Cut the shallot into thin half rings.
Mix in a small bowl per person: 1 tbsp white wine vinegar and 1 tsp honey. Add the shallot, season with salt and set aside until ready to use. Stir occasionally so that the flavors are well absorbed.
Bring water to the boil in a pan with a lid.
Remove the stems from the haricots verts and cut them in half. Cook for 4 - 6 minutes until al dente. Then drain and rinse under cold water.
Mix in a salad bowl per person: 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tsp mustard, 1 tbsp dressing from the shallots, salt and pepper. Add the green beans, pickled shallot and the mesclun. Mix well.
Divide the garlic-rosemary potatoes among plates and place 1 goat cheese patty on each plate. Serve with the fresh green beans salad. Serve with mayonnaise if desired.
