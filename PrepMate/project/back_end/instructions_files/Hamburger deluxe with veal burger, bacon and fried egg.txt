Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.
Wash the potatoes thoroughly and cut into wedges. Mix the potato wedges in a bowl with half the olive oil, salt and pepper. Spread them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and bake in the oven for 30 – 35 minutes.
In the meantime, roughly chop the little gem, halve the cherry tomatoes and cut the onion into half rings.
Heat a frying pan without cooking fat over medium heat and fry the bacon for 3 – 5 minutes until crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside, but save the pan for step 4. Break half the bacon into smaller pieces for the salad.
In a salad bowl, mix the honey, mustard, extra virgin olive oil and white wine vinegar into a dressing. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat the butter in another frying pan over medium heat and fry the onion for 2 minutes. Add the veal burger and fry for 4 – 5 minutes per side.
In the meantime, heat the remaining olive oil in the frying pan of the bacon and fry 1 fried egg per person.
Add the little gem, cherry tomatoes, crumbled bacon and gherkins to the salad bowl and mix well.
Cut open the sandwich. Place the veal burger and onions on top. Place the fried egg and the remaining bacon on top. Serve the burgers with the potato wedges, the American fries sauce and the salad.
