Chop the onion and press the garlic or chop finely. Cut the tomato into cubes.
Heat half the olive oil in a pan with a lid over medium heat and fry the onion for 2 minutes. Add the turmeric and fry for 1 minute. Add the rice and 200 ml of water per person. Crumble 1/4 vegetable stock cube per person above the pan and bring to the boil. Cook, covered, for 12 - 15 minutes. Add extra water if the rice boils dry too early. Then let it steam without the lid.
In the meantime, heat a wok or frying pan without oil over medium heat. Roast the cashew nuts for 1 minute and then add the coconut grater. Remove the topping from the pan as soon as it turns golden brown and keep aside.
Let the wok or frying pan of the topping cool slightly and then add the sunflower oil. Fry the garlic, curry powder, ground cumin seeds and chili flakes for 1 - 2 minutes over medium heat. Add the tomato and fry, stirring, for 4 minutes. Add the coconut milk. Crumble 1/4 vegetable stock cube per person above the pan and bring to the boil.
In the meantime, heat the remaining olive oil in a frying pan and fry 1 fried egg per person. Then tear the spinach into small pieces above the wok or frying pan with curry. Let it shrink while stirring and let it simmer for 1 - 2 minutes. Season further with salt and pepper if necessary.
Coarsely chop the coriander. Finely chop both the twigs and leaves.
Divide the rice and curry among the plates and garnish with the cashew-coconut topping and fresh coriander. Serve with the fried egg.
