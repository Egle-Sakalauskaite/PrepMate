Prepare the stock in a pan with a lid for the pearl couscous and bring the stock to the boil.
Press the garlic or chop finely.
Mix the regular olive oil with the garlic in a bowl and place the large shrimps in it. Leave to marinate until ready to bake in step 5.
Coarsely chop the walnuts.
Heat a frying pan without oil over medium heat and fry the walnuts until they start to brown. Remove from the pan and keep aside.
Strip the leaves from the tarragon sprigs and chop coarsely. Finely chop the dill.
In a small bowl, mix the walnuts with half the dill and half the tarragon.
Add the pearl couscous to the stock and cook, covered, for 12 - 14 minutes. Then drain the pearl couscous and rinse briefly under warm water.
In the meantime, cut the zucchini into half slices of 1/2 cm thick. Halve the fennel, cut into quarters and remove the hard core. Keep fennel foliage aside if necessary. Cut the fennel into small cubes.
Heat the butter in a frying pan over medium heat and fry the fennel for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini and cook together for a further 10 - 12 minutes, or until tender.
In the meantime, crumble the goat cheese. Cut the spring onion into thin rings and cut the olives into slices.
Just before serving, heat the frying pan over medium heat and fry the shrimp with marinade for 3 minutes, or until they are nicely pink.
Mix the pearl couscous, spring onion, olives and the remaining dill and tarragon with the zucchini and fennel. Season with salt and pepper.
Spoon the pearl couscous onto plates, divide the goat cheese over it and place the large shrimps next to it. Drizzle the olive oil with lemon over the shrimp. Garnish with the walnut topping and any fennel fronds.
