Dear recruiters of Vinted Data Science and Analytics Academy,

PrepMate is a Python-based desktop application I developed with my fellow students at TuDelft for the Computer Science Project course. To summarize briefly, it recommends recipes according to users' dietary needs. One of my responsibilities in this project was setting up the database that stores the recipes and user information. You can find the implementation methods in PrepMate\project\back_end\database.py
